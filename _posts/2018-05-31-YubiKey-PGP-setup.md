# How to configure 2 YubiKeys with the same PGP on Windows 10

## Install the latest version of Gpg4win (here 3.1.1 version was used, which contains GnuPG version 2.2.7)

## Let's check if installation worked, start command line

To keep English output set LANG variable.

    set LANG=C
    gpg --version


#### Check if you do not have any keys on your YubiKeys (both)

    gpg --card-status
    
    Signature key ....: [none]
    Encryption key....: [none]
    Authentication key: [none]
    General key info..: [none]

#### Configure both YubiKeys

Issue the same commands on both YubiKeys. In the rest of tutorial I have anonymized by personal details.

```
gpg --expert --edit-card

#### Create your offline master key (if you do not have it yet)

```
gpg --expert --full-generate-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
   (9) ECC and ECC
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (13) Existing key
Your selection? 8
```

Toogle cappabilities to only have Certify

```

```

weâ€™ll use a 4096-bit key as master

```
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
```

An expiry date is important so if you forget about the key (unlikely) it become invalid
In new version of GnuPG revocation keys are generated automatically
